8 am check in & 9 - noon clean up.

I believe if we set Brook Falls Lake as a meeting point we can plan on doing:
> Rosillo Creek from Windrock to Montgomery through Autumn Sunset and Brook Falls lakes
> Beitel Creek branch from Winn property line through Takas Park past Public Works
> Walzem Creek from Golf course/Midcrown past Windway to Windsor Hill
     Yes, all of our creekways drain into Salado
> Possibly also the other Beitel Creek branch along Crestwind if we are good for help.
